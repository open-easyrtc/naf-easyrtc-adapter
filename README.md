# Art Builds Multiplayer

This A-Frame based VR experience allows you to easily experience  3D models in a simulated environment with your collaborators. 

based on a NAF Easty RTC Adapter Network adapter fork: https://github.com/open-easyrtc/naf-easyrtc-adapter

I'm deploying on Heroku at https://art-builds.herokuapp.com/

Edit examples/index.html to import your own models.
